# Product Synchronization System Fix

## Issue Fixed
We addressed the issue where creating a new product caused an error with the message "Failed to save changes. Please try again." This was happening because we were trying to use a non-existent API endpoint for stock updates.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Added Missing API Endpoint
Added a new endpoint to server.js that handles stock updates:

```javascript
app.patch('/api/products/stock', async (req, res) => {
  // Handles individual product stock updates
  // Updates products.json when stock changes
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Product Sync Utilities
Enhanced the `productSyncUtils.ts` utility with a new method to notify about product creation:

```typescript
notifyProductCreated: (product: any) => {
  document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('productCreated', { 
    detail: { product } 
  }));
}
```

### 3. Updated ProductManager.tsx
- Added import for productSyncUtils
- Enhanced `handleAddProduct` to use productSyncUtils for notifying other components
- Enhanced `handleSaveProduct` to use productSyncUtils for syncing with file

### 4. Updated AdminDashboard.tsx
- Changed to use productSyncUtils.syncProducts instead of calling ProductFileService directly

## How Components Now Share product.json Data

All components now use the same unified system for managing product data:

1. **ProductContext.tsx**: Serves as the central source of truth for product data
2. **ProductManager.tsx**: For adding, editing, and deleting products
3. **Inventory.tsx**: For managing and tracking stock
4. **ProductCard.tsx**: For displaying products to customers 
5. **Checkout.tsx**: For processing orders and reducing stock

When any change happens to products (create/update/delete) or stock (increase/decrease):

1. The change is first applied to ProductContext
2. Events are dispatched to notify all components
3. The productSyncUtils utility handles file synchronization
4. The server endpoint processes the request and updates products.json

## Testing
You can now create new products, update existing ones, or adjust stock without encountering synchronization errors.

## Next Steps
If you encounter any issues with product data synchronization, check the browser console and server logs for specific error messages. The system now has consistent logging to help identify any problems.
